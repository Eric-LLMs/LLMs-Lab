# {"name": "AnalyseExcel", "args": {"query": "SELECT 联系人邮箱 FROM [Sheet1$] WHERE 供应商 LIKE '%PlayStation%'", "filename": "./data/Supplier Directory.xlsx"}}
# ```
# Based on the user's input, the task is to generate Python code that performs a SQL-like query on an Excel file. The query is to select the '联系人邮箱' (contact email) from the 'Sheet1' worksheet where the '供应商' (supplier) column contains the string '%PlayStation%'. The '%' symbol is used in SQL to denote a wildcard, which means that the query is looking for any supplier name that includes "PlayStation".
#
# (1) The user's input does not depend on a condition that has not been explicitly assigned. The condition is clear: select rows where the supplier name contains "PlayStation".
#
# (2) There is no need to make an assumption about the value of a certain variable. The file path and the columns to be used are provided, and the condition for the selection is specified.
#
# Given the constraints and the information provided, here is the Python code using the Pandas library to perform the required operation:
#
# ```python
# import pandas as pd
#
# # Load the Excel file
# file_path = './data/Supplier Directory.xlsx'
# sheet_name = 'Sheet1'
#
# # Read the specified sheet
# df = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name=sheet_name)
#
# # Perform the query to select rows where '供应商' contains 'PlayStation'
# # Since '%' is a wildcard in SQL, we use the `str.contains` method in Pandas
# # and assume that the user wants a case-insensitive search
# filtered_df = df[df['供应商'].str.contains('PlayStation', case=False, na=False)]
#
# # Select the '联系人邮箱' column from the filtered DataFrame
# contact_emails = filtered_df['联系人邮箱']
#
# # Output the result
# print(contact_emails.to_string(index=False))
# ```
#
# This code will read the specified Excel file, filter the rows based on the condition provided by the user, and print the '联系人邮箱' column of the filtered rows. The `str.contains` method is used with `case=False` to perform a case-insensitive search, and `na=False` to exclude NaN values from the search.

#
# Plan:
# A. The current action plan is to use the AnalyseExcel tool to list all suppliers' email addresses.
# B. I will use a SELECT query without a WHERE clause to retrieve all email addresses.
# C. There are no known constants that can be directly used in this analysis.
# D. The action does not depend on a value/definition that hasn’t been obtained.
# E. The action involves analyzing an Excel file to obtain the supplier's email address.
#
# Here is the action/tool I choose to execute:
# ```
# {"name": "AnalyseExcel", "args": {"query": "SELECT 供应商, 联系人邮箱 FROM [Sheet1$]", "filename": "./data/Supplier Directory.xlsx"}}
# ```
# Based on the user's input, the task is to generate Python code that reads data from an Excel file and selects specific columns from the first worksheet named 'Sheet1'. The columns to be selected are '供应商' and '联系人邮箱'. There is no condition in the user's input that depends on an unspecified variable, so we can proceed to generate the code without making any assumptions.
#
# Here is the Python code using the Pandas library to perform the specified operation:
#
# ```python
# import pandas as pd
#
# # Define the file path
# file_path = './data/Supplier Directory.xlsx'
#
# # Load the specified worksheet into a DataFrame
# df = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name='Sheet1')
#
# # Select the specified columns
# selected_columns = df[['供应商', '联系人邮箱']]
#
# # Output the result
# print(selected_columns)
# ```
#
# This code will read the Excel file located at './data/Supplier Directory.xlsx', specifically the 'Sheet1' worksheet, and then it will select and print the columns '供应商' and '联系人邮箱'.
# ----
# Result:
# SELECT 供应商, 联系人邮箱 FROM [Sheet1$]
