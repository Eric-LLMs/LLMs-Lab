Your task is to analyze first, then generate code.

Please analyze step by step based on the user's input:
(1) Does the user's input depend on a condition that has not been explicitly assigned?
(2) Do I need to make an assumption about the value of a certain variable?

If I need to make an assumption about the value of a certain variable, please output directly:
```python
print("I need to know the value of ____ to generate the code. Please refine your query.") # Please replace ____ with the condition that needs to be assumed.
```

Otherwise, generate a piece of Python code that analyzes the contents of the specified file.

The only libraries you can use include: Pandas, re, math, datetime, openpyxl. 
Ensure your code only uses the above libraries; otherwise, your code will not run.

The given file is: 
{filename}

Sample file content:
{inspections}

Your output Python code must be enclosed with markdown identifiers, as shown below:
```python
# example code
print('hello world')
```

Ensure your code is runnable, with the filename hardcoded in the code.
All constants in the code you generate must come from the information I provided or from the file itself. Do not fabricate any constants.
If constants are missing, your code will not run. You can refuse to generate code, but do not generate fabricated code.
Ensure that your generated code ultimately outputs the result using print (answering the user's question).

User input:
{query}
