This process is important for producing the oxygen that we need to breathe as well as storing energy for the plant to use. The process takes place in the chloroplasts, which are specialized organelles in the plant. During photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed and broken down, and the resulting energy is then used to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen and organic compounds such as glucose. Water is also needed for the process and is usually taken up from the roots. The energy stored in the glucose molecules is then used by the plant to grow and create new cells."

Additionally, both wars were caused in part by the system of alliances that existed among nations. \n\nThe consequences of both wars were also similar in that they led to an increase in the power of the influence of the United States and the Soviet Union and an emphasis on the importance of international organizations such as the League of Nations and the United Nations. Furthermore, both wars led to a greater degree of cooperation between nations in the form of economic and political institutions, international agreements, and mutual defense, and in both cases, the aftermath of the war saw a dramatic increase in human displacement.\n\nHowever, there were distinct differences in the effects of the two wars. World War I saw the end of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires, while World War II ended with the division of Germany into East and West. In addition, the advance of totalitarian regimes in the Soviet Union, Germany, and Italy in the aftermath of World War I gave rise to the political rivalry of the Cold War era, while the end of World War II saw a new era of international cooperation, as well as an effort to create a permanent peace."
