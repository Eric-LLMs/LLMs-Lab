# LLMs-Lab-2024

This repository contains projects, research, and educational resources focused on Large Language Models (LLMs).

1. **Task-oriented Dialogue System**
   - Implementing a Multi-Turn, Task-Oriented Intelligent Customer Service System demo using the OpenAI API.
  
2. **Function-Calling**
   - POI: Function Calling uses Amap's (Gaode Map) public API to retrieve information about hotels, restaurants, attractions, and other points of interest (POIs) near a specific location. In other words, it allows querying nearby POIs relative to a given POI.
   - SQL:Function Calling handles sophisticated database tasks and generates SQL queries.
   - Stream: examples of Function Calling in Stream mode

2. **RAG**
   I implemented two different RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines. The first one is based on Elasticsearch (ES), and the second one is based on a vector database, ChromaDb.
   - run_RAG_vector_database_pipline: RAG Pipeline based on ChromaDb Vector Database.
   - run_RAG_ES_pipline: RAG Pipeline based on Elasticsearch (ES).
